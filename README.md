# Neural-Network-From-Sratch
Built a Single Layer Neural Network from scratch using only NumPy, trained on the Iris dataset. Implemented custom forward and backward propagation, an SVM-inspired loss function, and manual gradient descent updates without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
